I would like to create a flashcard app

Use pipenv

Create cards with a front and back and review them

Deck Table:
    Deck_name
    Deck ID:
    Parent Deck (to create subdecks)

Card Table:
    Front
    Back
    ID
    date created
    date last edited

Deck Card Pivot:
    Card ID
    Deck ID

Review Table:
    Card_ID
    last studied
    Score (passed, hard, failed)


Create a due list
Give each card a strength rating so you can sort the deck by it

1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
